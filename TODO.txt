[x] save the model and use it on new stuff!
[ ] Modify the training data to just be either 1s or 0s. The model is pretty bad otherwise
[ ] graph the accuracy over each iteration
    [ ] add multiples lines showing how learning rate affects this
[ ] Start with a 100% activation of a certain number and then work backwards
    to the inputs to see what the neural network views as a certain number

[ ] Do some image processing to center the drawn number
    Optimal solution: make the drawing box only 20 x 20 and have the 8 rows and columns be permanently black
    Cool solution: actually do the image preocessing lol
[ ] use the weights between layers to see what patterns the network is picking up on
